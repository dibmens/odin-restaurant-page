      <h3>PATRICE O'NEAL<br>1969 - 2011</h3>
      <p>A New York native stand-up comedian, Patrice came to prominence for his guest roles on various comedy shows throughout the 00s. Armed with a sharp tongue, he rarely made fast friends, but those who got to know him well saw a man with a big heart and still miss him. The restaurant menu is inspired by one such guest appearance.</p>
